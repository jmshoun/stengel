    "`break_y` is very discrete, and therefore unlikely to be much help. Beyond that, it's clear that we have essentially four separate parameterizations of the movement of the ball (relative to normal expectations). `break_length` and `break_angle` can be thought of as the polar-coordinate representation of the movement, and `spin_direction` and `spin_rate` are polar-coordinate representations of the underlying process that causes the ball to accelerate. The other two parameterizations use Cartesian coordinates. The fact that `delta_*` and `accel_*` are so tightly coupled is no surprise, when we consider that no external forces (other than the Magnus effect) are working on the ball as it flies, so of course any deviation from a normal trajectory would manifest itself as acceleration early on. We prefer the `accel_*` parameterization for consistency's sake."

The reason the correlation isn't stronger is likely because of the noise introduced by the other variables that influence pitch type -- for a consistent type of pitch thrown, the correlation between `start_*` and `plate_*` should be much higher. For the same reason that we prefer to exclude `plate_*`, we'll exclude `start_*` for the sake of the pitch classification model. Furthermore, it looks like `start_*` and `accel_*` are fairly orthogonal -- it looks like we aren't gaining extra insight into the pitcher's mechanics (and therefore his choice of pitch) from the coordinates of his release point."

    "This leaves us with a promising set of variables for pitch classification. Essentially, we could use the first and second derivatives of the ball's position in three dimensions at a particular point in its flight path to determine what kind of pitch it is. This is enormously satisfying, both statistically (using only six variables is immensely preferable to using 22), and mechanically (given that we consider a pitch's location to be orthogonal to how it was thrown, a complete description of its movement at a single point in time should be sufficient to reconstruct any other metric describing its flight path, at least to a first-order approximation)."

    "However, we could reduce the number of variables in the model even further. `accel_y` is strongly related to `velocity_y` for fairly obvious reasons -- the faster a ball is moving, the greater the air resistance it will encounter, and the faster it will decelerate. Furthermore, there doesn't appear to be a lot of clustering segmentation due to `velocity_x` and `velocity_z`. Therefore, if we drop those three variables, we are left with three simple variables that do a very good job of clustering pitch types: `velocity_y` (how fast the pitch was thrown, and `accel_x` and `accel_z` (the pitch's movement relative to the plane of the strike zone, expressed in Cartesian coordinates)."
